# A virtual host only lasts for the session when
# using the VHOST command. If you want to make the
# vhost permanent, you must add an entry in this file.
# If ident is set to "*", all users from the same host
# will have the same vhost.
# host can be an IP address, hostname, or "*" for any host.
# vhost must be a valid hostname or IP address.
