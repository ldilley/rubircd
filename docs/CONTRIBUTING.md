## Coding Convention

RubIRCd attempts to follow the convention employed by [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) outlined [here](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide). There is still much cleanup work to do. Please follow this styling as closely as possible for any code contributions.
